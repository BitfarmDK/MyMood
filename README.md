# MyMood

This showcase app can assist with a common therapeutic treatment, where the patient is asked to journal frequently to record their state of mind. This method is used as part of a treatment plan for many different conditions (including depression and schizophrenia).

With MyMood the user can visualize their journal as a WhenCast and share it with their counselor.

MyMood is not suitable to be used by real patients and some features are only partially implemented.

Disclaimer: I am not psychotherapist, this implementation of the treatment is simply based on something I heard someone talk about...

To launch MyMood:
- You must have a Mac computer with Xcode installed. (I used Xcode 8.3.2)
- Download the project.
- Open the project in Xcode.
- Select a simulator (I recommend iPhone SE).
- Press "Run".
